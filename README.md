# refactor-challenge

# Motivataion?
The refactor challenge was an assignment where I used everything I learned from Bootcamp Week 1 and I applied it.

# Why? 
I did this project as a way to practice what I learned from week 1.

# What did it solve?
The task was to refactor the original code and make sure it followed accessibility standards.

# What did I learn?
Using this challenge, I learned what refactoring is, the importance of making sure websites can be used by everyone, and that the better your code/website the higher the chance of your webpage being one of the firsts to show up on a search engine.
